# Self-driving-vehicle-coding
 This is a project for the Bright Network internship experience 2022 Amazon coding challenge
 Phase 1 is aiming to find the shortest path for the self-driving-vehicle (robot) from the start to the delivery point. The obstacles in this case is fixed.
 Phase 2 is more challenging, because 20 additional obstacles are generated in the map randomly. The aim is still to find the shortest path.
 However, in Phase 2, there is a possibility that the robot cannot reach the delivery point eventually due to obstacles blocking all the routes. In this case, a warning of unable to reach delivery point will be printed to remind the user.
